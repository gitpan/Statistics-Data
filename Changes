Revision history for perl module Statistics-Data

0.07 2013-08-06
    - cleanup some code re access()
    - remove errant print() check statement
    - attempt solve test issues under cygwin (no hash bangs to perl)
    - rewrote abstract and synopsis

0.06 2013-08-04
    - extended check for hash of arefs passed to load/add, from simply checking that $args[1] is aref - see _isa_hash_of_arefs() called by _init_data() via add()
    - clarified _init_data() logics by further subroutining
    - extended POD manual to better describe accepted data structures for load() and add(), + other misc. POD revisions
    - misc. "best practice" code revisions, passing all level >= 4 severities via Perl::Critic

0.05 2013-08-03
    - all_numeric() and all_proportions() now check that all values are defined and have content as per String::Util hascontent()
    - all_proportions() changed so that it does not accept strings that look like (some) proportions, incl. removing prior custom regex

0.04 2013-08-02
    - added all_full() method - checking data values are defined and have content as per String::Util hascontent()
    - added methods ndata(), share(), all_numeric() and all_proportions() (previously documented but not fully implemented)
    - read() method renamed access() to avoid any builtin fn conflict; 'read' still supported as an alias for the time being
    - list() method renamed dump_list(); 'list' still supported as an alias for the time being
    - dump_line() method renamed dump_vals() because it is not always a line; aliased as for legacy support for now
    - save() method renamed save_to_file(), and open() renamed load_from_file(), for clarity and avoid builtin fn conflict; prior names supported as undocumented aliases for now
    - args relevant to saving & loading to/from file now to be given only within save_to_file() and load_from_file() - not in new(), as Data::Serializer is now only 'required' within these subroutines, not 'used' from begin
    - removed freeze() and thaw() methods as feature-creep; maybe 'slurp' or load_from_file() and access() after save_to_file() instead
    - import() added as alias for share()
    - misc. POD manual and "best practice" code revisions
