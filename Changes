Revision history for perl module Statistics-Data

0.04 2013-08-02
    - added all_full() method
    - completed/further tests of methods ndata(), share(), all_numeric() and all_proportions().
    - read() method is now known as access() to avoid any builtin fn conflict; but still supported as an alias for the time being
    - list() method is now known as dump_list(); still supported for legacy
    - dump_line() method is now known as dump_vals() because it is not always a line
    = renamed save() as save_to_file(), and open() as load_from_file(), for clarity and avoid builtin fn conflict; prior names supported as undocumented aliases for now
    - arguments for saving and loading to/from file must now be given only in these methods - not in new() as Data::Serializer is only now 'required' here, not 'used' from begin.
    - removed freeze() and thaw() methods as feature-creep; maybe slurp or load_from_file and access after save_to_file instead.
    - import() is alias for share()
    - Misc. POD and "best practice" revisions
